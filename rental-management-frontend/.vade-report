# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the rental management frontend application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package (v1.3.1)
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Code Integration
**Modified: `src/App.tsx`**
- Added import statement for `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component to the main App component, placed after the `<Toaster />` component within the Router

## Implementation Details

This is a React + Vite application, so I followed the documentation for React applications:
- Used the `@vercel/speed-insights/react` package variant
- Added the `SpeedInsights` component at the root level of the application to track all routes
- Placed the component inside the Router but outside the Suspense boundary to ensure it's always mounted

## Next Steps

To complete the Speed Insights setup:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. After deployment, verify that the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script is loaded in the browser
4. View performance metrics in the Vercel dashboard under the Speed Insights tab

## Build Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced (existing linting warnings are pre-existing)
- ✅ Package dependencies properly updated

The application is ready to start tracking performance metrics once deployed to Vercel.
