# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration in the rental-management-frontend React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json with the new dependency

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.tsx**
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the Router component, after the Toaster component
  - This placement ensures analytics tracking works across all routes in the application

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the official Vercel Web Analytics documentation for React/Vite applications:
- Used the `@vercel/analytics/react` package for React framework integration
- Placed the Analytics component inside the Router component to enable automatic route tracking
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when the app is deployed to Vercel

## Verification

1. ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
2. ✅ No new linting errors introduced by the changes
3. ✅ Analytics component properly integrated into the application structure

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. Verify analytics are working by checking for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests in browser Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Notes

- The Analytics component is lightweight and won't affect application performance
- Analytics will only track data when the application is deployed to Vercel
- In development mode, the component gracefully handles the absence of Vercel infrastructure
- Route changes are automatically tracked due to the component being placed inside the Router
